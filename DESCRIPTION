Description: Performs survival analysis for one-way layout. The package includes the generalized test for survival ANOVA (Tsui and Weerahandi (1989) <doi:10.2307/2289949> and (Weerahandi, 2004; ISBN:978-0471470175)). It also performs pairwise comparisons and graphical approaches. Moreover, it assesses the weibullness of data in each group via test. The package computes mean and confidence interval under Weibull distribution.
